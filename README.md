HEARTS GIVEN - 3/8
—--Level 1—-- (dorm) 
The night before your school day, you’re ready to go to your bed and sleep at 11pm because you have an early 8am class the next morning. As you look around your room, you notice your roommate deeply engrossed in playing Genshin Impact. Suddenly, a mischievous idea sparks in your mind… 
Choice 1 - sleep first
>>> "I have an early class tomorrow. I should stick to my sleep schedule."
Gain heart +1
Choice 2 - play game
>>>  “It’s just for a while, I’ll catch up on sleep later.”
You end up playing Genshin and sleeping late (3am)...
      “SHOOT!! It’s almost morning-”
Lose heart -1
It’s the next day, and you’re thinking whether to take a bath or skip it because you are too lazy to bathe in the early morning. 
Choice 1 - SKIP: “I’ll smell fine right?”
> Lose a heart: Your crush looks at you weird and stays away from you in class.
Choice 2 - Take a bath
> Gain a heart: Your crush comes and compliments you: “You smell so good today.”

As you walk towards your class, you spot a cute cat ahead of you, seemingly eager for attention. It stops and looks at you with its big curious eyes...
Choice 1 - Play with the cat: “Hi cutie, good morningg!!”
> Lose a heart: You’re late for class
Choice 2 - Ignore the cat: “ …”
> Gain a heart: You arrive just in time for class

END - <<< LEVEL COMPLETE >>> Good luck for your next level!



—--Level 2—-- (class)
You enter your classroom bustling with noise. Many students have already arrived, and every seat seems occupied. You are trying hard searching for a spot to sit when the lecturer, Mr Winwin, notices your problem. “Why don’t you grab a chair and sit at the front? There’s still a lot of space here. Don’t be scared. I won’t eat you ehehe.”, he said.
Choice 1 - Accept Mr Winwin suggestion. 
                 “Sure, I’ll take a chair and sit at the front. It’s my pleasure :-) “  
> Gain a heart: Successfully sit at an ‘ideal’ seat, which can make you concentrate more in the lecture.
Choice 2 - Continue searching for a seat.
                  Opt for a seat at the back, potentially escaping the lecturer’s
                  watchful eye. (and wanna sit with your crush)
> Lose a heart: Trip over a backpack of your classmate while finding a seat at the back.

During the lecture, you start dozing off and scrolling through memes on Twitter. However, Mr Winwin is passionately teaching a complex topic, and this topic will come up in the final as well :-0. What will you do?
Choice 1 - Use matches to hold up your eyelids in order to keep your eyes open like what Mr Bean did to avoid dozing off while driving.
> Gain a heart: Tried your best to stay focused although others will laugh at you.
Choice 2 - Pinching yourself, tapping fingers on the desk, shaking your leg and even leaning back on your chair to stay focused.
> Lose a heart: You accidentally hit the point of no return and you fall down when you lean back too far in your chair. >>>Your life flashes before your eyes…
Choice 3 - You miss your bed so so so much. So you ask Mr Winwin’s permission to go to the WC, pretending to be in an emergency….
> Lose two hearts: A suspicious look, an eyebrow raised are given by Mr Winwin. He knows you're trying to escape his class under the guise of a toilet emergency, He then teasingly remarked, “Oh really? I suddenly feel a bit urgent too.”

Finally, the class is coming to an end. Before it dismisses, Mr Winwin, with his smirking face, says, “Alright, folks, before you dash off, I have a little surprise for you! Survive the unexpected pop quiz and leave the classroom alive!”
The room filled with a sound of disappointment as students realized their happiness was interrupted. Some students immediately delve into their notes, quickly scanning their notes and the materials.

Question: 
>>> repeating the question (while loop) until the player gets it right


END - <<< LEVEL COMPLETE >>> Good luck for your next level!


—--Level 3—-- (after class)
Rough script : 
(After class)
You step out of the classroom, backpack slung over one shoulder, as the sun sets over the university campus. You are so ready to head over to your room and just lay down lazily on your bed while scrolling through your phone.

But your mind changes when you see a bunch of crowds and stalls around the campus. “Should I buy something first ?”

Choice 1 : buy at pop up stall: You’ve seen a takoyaki stall and instantly head there to make your purchase. 
> Lose two heart: Out of budget:
When you open your wallet, you realise that this is the last cash that you  own - “I had overspent!”

Choice 2 : buy at haji tapah 
“ Maybe not, I almost reached my budget. Let ‘s just buy at haji tapah for cheaper price..”
> Heart remains: You save your money!


(back to the event bg)
Choice 1 : go back to hostel 
> Lose a heart: forgot your group discussion (bad ending)

Choice 2 : walk around campus for a while 
>Gain a heart: You remember your group discussion (good ending)

<<<GAME OVER>>>
Your remaining heart: ?
> if the player has managed to preserve at least one heart (heart >=1):
“Congratulations! You’re a legend in decision-making.”

(*IF POSSIBLE: NAVIGATE TO THIS PAGE IF PLAYER’S REMAINING HEART = 0) 
> if the player losses all hearts (heart == 0): 
“GAME OVER - Zero Hearts Left!”
“Remember, making better choices is key. Retry for a better day!”
